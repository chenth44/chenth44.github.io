Welcome to my homepage! I am a research assistant at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, working under the supervision of [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com). Currently, our research focuses on non-coding RNA annotation using deep learning. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree (first honor) in Computer Science from **CUHK** in 2022. My bachelor thesis, supervised by [Prof. Chi-Wing Fu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/), focused on 3D object detection.

My research interests span a variety of fields, including deep learning, computer vision, computer graphics, and bioinformatics. I am passionate about leveraging the power of deep learning to address real-world problems and enhance the quality of our lives.

I am also an amateur violinist and music creator. I am a fan of classical music.
